## Hobbies and Tunes 🌈🎶

In my downtime, you'll catch me indulging in the magical worlds of anime, conquering virtual realms in games, binge-watching web series and movies. When I'm not lost in lines of code, I immerse myself in the symphony of music. My favorite band? Ciggs After Sex, all thanks to the enchanting androgynous voice of their main vocal artist.

*A little more about me:* 🧠

Apathetic doesn't mean I'm indifferent in a bad way. I just don't get worked up about things very easily. I'm not easily excited or disappointed. I'm not easily angered or saddened.

But that doesn't mean I don't care. I do care. I care about my work. I care about my friends. I care about the world. I just don't let my emotions control me. I don't let them get in the way of my thinking.

I'm a programmer. I'm a problem solver. I'm a creator. I use my skills to make things. I use my skills to solve problems. I use my skills to make the world a better place.

Of course, I'm not without flaws. Like everyone, I am prone to making errors, but I don't view these as setbacks. Instead, I embrace them as opportunities for growth and learning. Continual self-improvement remains a guiding principle in my journey through life, a commitment to always strive for betterment.
